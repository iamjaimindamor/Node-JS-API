# ReST API using NodeJS


⟹ ReST stands for Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style for designing networked applications. 
<br>

## 🚀 Let's Get Started


⟹ A REST API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services that adhere to the principles of REST.


⟹ RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources. The most common HTTP methods used in REST are:

✒️GET: Retrieve a representation of a resource.

✒️POST: Create a new resource.

✒️PUT: Update an existing resource or create a new resource if it doesn't exist.

✒️DELETE: Remove a resource.

✒️PATCH: Partially update a resource.

✒️OPTIONS: Get information about the communication options available for a resource.
