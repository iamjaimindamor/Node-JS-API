// JWT stands for json-web-token
//jwt consist of three part header.payload.signature

/* header has two components first is type of token and algortihm used */
 
/** payload consist of claims {Claims are nothing but content or additinational data typically about the user or client}
 
There are three types of claims :
1.Registered claim
2.public claim
3.private claim 

Registered claim are pre-defined claim...like issuer,exp

public claim can be defined at will as per IANA Registry to avoid collision

private claim are custom claims(additional data or content) that are shared between parties.................

NOTE: the information stored in token are visible when the token is accessible therfore sensitive information should not be mentioned unless it is encrypted...

And lastly the signature........ 

the signature takes encoded header.encoded payload.and secret key and signs it as per the algorithm mentioned in the header section.....

//bycrypt..........................................................................................................

//sensitive information like password...
/**
 * Hash is fixed-length string generated using hashing algorithm............................
 *so in bycrypt which uses blowfish cyper...
 in this the simple plain text password is put through the hashing algo..... a hash is generated..... but using this hash it possible to trace back to password...as specific password always yield same hash....
 so salting is also used which randomize the hash and making it unpredicatable.............

 saltRound = higher the value of round more times the algo takes and also high number of chances of preventing attack..................
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * bycrypt hash is used because it one of earliest used package since 1999 and blowfish cypher till now unbeatable....... and supported by many contributors..........
